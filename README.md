# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Analysis with Data Visualization

## **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing student performance data sourced from Kaggle's **"Students Exam Scores: Extended Dataset"**. The goal was to preprocess the dataset, clean missing values, and visualize various aspects of the data to identify patterns and insights.

The dataset includes students' scores in three subjectsâ€”Math, Reading, and Writingâ€”alongside socio-economic variables such as gender, parental education, marital status, and more. The dataset contains **over 30,000 rows** and **15 columns**, making it ideal for exploring relationships between different factors and student performance.

## **Dataset**

- **Source**: [Students Exam Scores: Extended Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/desalegngeb/students-exam-scores)
- **Description**: Fictional data for educational purposes, including test scores and socio-economic information.

### **Features of the Dataset**
- **Gender**: Gender of the student (male/female)
- **EthnicGroup**: Ethnic group of the student (A to E)
- **ParentEduc**: Parent(s) education background
- **LunchType**: School lunch type (standard or free/reduced)
- **TestPrep**: Test preparation course status (completed or none)
- **ParentMaritalStatus**: Parent(s) marital status (married/single/widowed/divorced)
- **PracticeSport**: How often the student practices sport
- **IsFirstChild**: Whether the child is the first in the family
- **NrSiblings**: Number of siblings the student has
- **TransportMeans**: Means of transport to school
- **WklyStudyHours**: Weekly self-study hours
- **MathScore**: Math test score (0-100)
- **ReadingScore**: Reading test score (0-100)
- **WritingScore**: Writing test score (0-100)

## **Tech Stack**

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for analysis and backend logic.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: To create meaningful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **Flask**: For building a web interface to display visualizations.
- **HTML & CSS**: To structure and style the user interface.

## **Data Analysis & Visualization**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Removed unnecessary columns like `Unnamed: 0`.
- Dealt with missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset (e.g., cleaned up the `WklyStudyHours` column).

### **2. Visualization Techniques**
- **Bar Charts**: Gender distribution.
- **Heatmaps**: To compare student scores across different parent education levels and marital status.
- **Boxplots**: To display the distribution of Math, Reading, and Writing scores.
- **Pie Charts**: To show the distribution of ethnic groups.

## **Installation Instructions**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the Flask app by running:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **View the Dashboard**

   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser to access the dashboard.

## **Key Insights**

- **Gender Distribution**: Female students are slightly more represented in the dataset.
- **Parent Education & Scores**: Students with parents having higher education levels tend to score better in all subjects.
- **Ethnic Group Distribution**: Group C had the highest representation in the dataset, and this group showed a balanced performance across the subjects.

## **Future Improvements**

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Consider using Plotly for more interactive charts.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Build predictive models to forecast student scores based on socio-economic factors.
- **Deeper Analysis**: Explore correlations and statistical tests to validate the relationships observed in the dataset.
